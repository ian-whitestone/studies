# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Overview

The City of Toronto has published all parking tickets issued in the last 9 year, available through their [Open Data Portal](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=ca20256c54ea4310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD). This repo houses the cleaning & analysis of this data. An interactive visualization was created to show a map-based view of the highest grossing areas in Toronto. This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
